# Diabetes-Detection-using-data-science-techniques

Project Title: Diabetes Detection Using Machine Learning
1. Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for diabetes detection using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains medical diagnostic measurements that help determine whether a patient has diabetes.

2. Dataset
Name: PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset (from UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle)
Features:
Pregnancies
Glucose
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
Outcome (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic)
3. Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Modeling: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks
Notebook: Jupyter Notebook
4. Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing
